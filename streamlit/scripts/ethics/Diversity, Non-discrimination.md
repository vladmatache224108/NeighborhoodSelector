# Avoidance of Unfair Bias


##  Did you establish a strategy or a set of procedures to avoid creating or reinforcing unfair bias in the AI system, both regarding the use of input data as well as for the algorithm design?

As a school project without a deployed AI system, we cannot say if we established a strategy or set of procedures to avoid creating or reinforcing unfair bias. However, it is important to consider and address potential biases in the use of input data and algorithm design to ensure fairness.


##  Did you consider diversity and representativeness of end-users and/or subjects in the data?

As a school project without a deployed AI system, we cannot say if we considered diversity and representativeness of end-users and/or subjects in the data. However, it is important to consider such factors in the data to avoid bias and ensure fairness.


##  Did you test for specific target groups or problematic use cases?

As a school project without a deployed AI system, we cannot say if we tested for specific target groups or problematic use cases. However, testing for such cases is important to identify and address potential biases in the AI system.


##  Did you research and use publicly available technical tools, that are state-of- the-art, to improve your understanding of the data, model and performance?

As a school project without a deployed AI system, we cannot say if we assessed and put in place processes to test and monitor for potential biases during the entire lifecycle. However, such processes are important to ensure fairness and mitigate the risk of bias in the AI system.


##  Did you assess and put in place processes to test and monitor for potential biases during the entire lifecycle of the AI system (e.g. biases due to possible limitations stemming from the composition of the used data sets (lack of diversity, non-representativeness)?

As a school project without a deployed AI system, we cannot say if we assessed and put in place processes to test and monitor for potential biases during the entire lifecycle. However, such processes are important to ensure fairness and mitigate the risk of bias in the AI system.


##  Where relevant, did you consider diversity and representativeness of end-users and or subjects in the data?


• Did you put in place educational and awareness initiatives to help AI designers and
AI developers be more aware of the possible bias they can inject in designing and
developing the AI system?
• Did you ensure a mechanism that allows for the flagging of issues related to bias,
discrimination or poor performance of the AI system?
##  Did you establish clear steps and ways of communicating on how and to whom such issues can be raised?

As a school project without a deployed AI system, we cannot say if we established clear steps and ways of communicating on how and to whom such issues can be raised. However, establishing such clear steps is important to ensure accountability and transparency in addressing issues related to the AI system.


##  Did you identify the subjects that could potentially be (in)directly affected by the AI system, in addition to the (end-)users and/or subjects?

As a school project without a deployed AI system, we cannot say if we identified subjects that could potentially be (in)directly affected by the AI system. However, identifying such subjects is important to ensure fairness and mitigate any potential negative effects of the AI system.

## Is your definition of fairness commonly used and implemented in any phase of the process of setting up the AI system?

As a school project without a deployed AI system, we cannot say if our definition of fairness is commonly used and implemented in any phase of the process of setting up the AI system. However, it is important to ensure that a clear and appropriate definition of fairness is used and implemented in the process of setting up the AI system.


##  Did you consider other definitions of fairness before choosing this one?

As a school project without a deployed AI system, we cannot say if we considered other definitions of fairness before choosing one. However, considering different definitions of fairness can help ensure that the chosen definition is appropriate and effective.


##  Did you consult with the impacted communities about the correct definition of fairness, i.e. representatives of elderly persons or persons with disabilities?

As a school project without a deployed AI system, we cannot say if we consulted with impacted communities about the correct definition of fairness. However, consulting with impacted communities can help ensure that the chosen definition is appropriate and effective.


##  Did you ensure a quantitative analysis or metrics to measure and test the applied definition of fairness?

As a school project without a deployed AI system, we cannot say if we ensured a quantitative analysis or metrics to measure and test the applied definition of fairness. However, such analysis and metrics are important to evaluate the effectiveness of the chosen definition of fairness.
##  Did you establish mechanisms to ensure fairness in your AI system?

As a school project without a deployed AI system, we cannot say if we established mechanisms to ensure fairness in our AI system. However, establishing such mechanisms is important to ensure that the AI system is fair and free from bias.

Accessibility and Universal Design
Particularly in business-to-consumer domains, AI systems should be user-centric and
designed in a way that allows all people to use AI products or services, regardless of their
age, gender, abilities or characteristics. Accessibility to this technology for persons with
disabilities, which are present in all societal groups, is of particular importance. AI systems
should not have a one-size-fits-all approach and should consider Universal Design
principles30 addressing the widest possible range of users, following relevant accessibility
standards.31 This will enable equitable access and active participation of all people in
existing and emerging computer-mediated human activities and with regard to assistive
technologies.
##  Did you ensure that the AI system corresponds to the variety of preferences and abilities in society?

Yes, the AI system was designed to be user-centric and considers the various preferences and abilities of all people, regardless of age, gender, or characteristics.


##  Did you assess whether the AI system's user interface is usable by those with special needs or disabilities or those at risk of exclusion?

Yes, we assessed the usability of the AI system's user interface for individuals with special needs or disabilities, as well as those at risk of exclusion.


##  Did you ensure that information about, and the AI system's user interface of, the AI system is accessible and usable also to users of assistive technologies (such as screen readers)?

No we have not implemented something such as screen readers seeing how this is a small school project.


##  Did you involve or consult with end-users or subjects in need for assistive technology during the planning and development phase of the AI system?

No we have not implemented something to assistive technology seeing how this is a small school project.


##  Did you ensure that Universal Design principles are taken into account during every step of the planning and development process, if applicable?

Yes, we ensured that Universal Design principles were taken into account during every step of the planning and development process.


##  Did you take the impact of the AI system on the potential end-users and/or subjects into account?

Yes, we took the impact of the AI system on potential end-users and/or subjects into account.


##  Did you assess whether the team involved in building the AI system engaged with the possible target end-users and/or subjects?

Yes, we assessed whether the team involved in building the AI system engaged with the possible target end-users and/or subjects.


##  Did you assess whether there could be groups who might be disproportionately affected by the outcomes of the AI system?

No, we have not assessed whether there could be groups who might be disproportionately affected by the outcomes of the AI system.


##  Did you assess the risk of the possible unfairness of the system onto the end-user's or subject's communities?

Yes, we assessed the risk of the possible unfairness of the system onto the end-users or subject's communities.




Stakeholder Participation
In order to develop Trustworthy AI, it is advisable to consult stakeholders who may directly
or indirectly be affected by the AI system throughout its life cycle. It is beneficial to solicit
regular feedback even after deployment and set up longer term mechanisms for stakeholder
participation, for example by ensuring workers information, consultation and participation
throughout the whole process of implementing AI systems at organisations.
• ##Did you consider a mechanism to include the participation of the widest range of
possible stakeholders in the AI system’s design and development?

It's essential to involve a wide range of stakeholders in AI system design and development through methods consultations with the product owner. Engagement should continue after deployment to address any concerns, and worker participation is vital.
