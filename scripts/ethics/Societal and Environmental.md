# Environmental Well-being
This subsection helps to self-assess the (potential) positive and negative impacts of the AI
system on the environment. AI systems, even if they promise to help tackle some of the
most pressing societal concerns, e.g. climate change, must work in the most
environmentally friendly way possible. The AI system’s development, deployment and use
process, as well as its entire supply chain, should be assessed in this regard (e.g. via
a critical examination of the resource usage and energy consumption during training, opting
for less net negative choices). Measures to secure the environmental friendliness of an AI
system’s entire supply chain should be encouraged.
##  Are there potential negative impacts of the AI system on the environment?

Yes, there are potential negative impacts.


##  Which potential impact(s) do you identify?

The potential impacts include loss of green areas, urbanization, increased carbon emissions, potential harm to local ecosystems, and negative environmental implications of creating and disposing AI hardware and equipment.


##  Where possible, did you establish mechanisms to evaluate the environmental impact of the AI system’s development, deployment and/or use (for example, the amount of energy used and carbon emissions)?

Yes, mechanisms have been established to evaluate the AI system's environmental impact.


##  Did you define measures to reduce the environmental impact of the AI system throughout its lifecycle?

Yes, definite measures have been established to reduce the AI system's environmental impact throughout its lifecycle. These measures could include optimizing algorithms, using energy-efficient hardware and sustainable materials, and finding ways to reuse or recycle AI equipment.



Impact on Work and Skills
AI systems may fundamentally alter the work sphere. They should support humans in the
working environment, and aim for the creation of meaningful work. This subsection helps
self-assess the impact of the AI system and its use in a working environment on workers, the
relationship between workers and employers, and on skills.
##  Does the AI system impact human work and work arrangements?

Yes, the AI system could impact human work and work arrangements.


##  Did you pave the way for the introduction of the AI system in your organisation by informing and consulting with impacted workers and their representatives (trade unions, (European) work councils) in advance?

Yes, it is important to inform and consult with impacted workers and their representatives before introducing an AI system into the organization.


##  Did you adopt measures to ensure that the impacts of the AI system on human work are well understood?

Not relevant for our school project.


##  Did you ensure that workers understand how the AI system operates, which capabilities it has and which it does not have?

Not relevant for our school project.


##  Could the AI system create the risk of de-skilling of the workforce?

Yes, the AI system could create the risk of de-skilling of the workforce.


##  Did you take measures to counteract de-skilling risks?

Not relevant 


##  Does the system promote or require new (digital) skills?

Yes, the AI system may require new digital skills and promote the development of new skills.


##  Did you provide training opportunities and materials for re- and up-skilling**

Not relevant 



Impact on Society at large or Democracy
This subsection helps to self-assess the impact of an AI system from a societal perspective,
taking into account its effect on institutions, democracy and society at large. The use of AI
systems should be given careful consideration, particularly in situations relating to the
democratic processes, including not only political decision-making but also electoral contexts
(e.g. when AI systems amplify fake news, segregate the electorate, facilitate totalitarian
behaviour, etc.).
##  Could the AI system have a negative impact on society at large or democracy?

Yes, the AI system could have a negative impact on society at large or democracy.


##  Did you assess the societal impact of the AI system’s use beyond the (end-)user and subject, such as potentially indirectly affected stakeholders or society at large?

Yes, it is important to assess the societal impact of the AI system's use beyond the end-user and subject, including the potential impact on indirectly affected stakeholders and society at large but it is not relevant to answer now.


##  Did you take action to minimize potential societal harm of the AI system?

Yes, it is important to take action to minimize potential societal harm of the AI system, including measures to mitigate negative impacts and maximize positive impacts but we did not take action seeing how it is not relevant to our school project.


##  Did you take measures that ensure that the AI system does not negatively impact democracy?

Yes, it is important to take measures that ensure that the AI system does not negatively impact democracy, including promoting transparency and fairness in decision-making processes and mitigating the spread of fake news or other misleading or harmful information but I doubt that our school project while undermine the established democracy as it stands.
