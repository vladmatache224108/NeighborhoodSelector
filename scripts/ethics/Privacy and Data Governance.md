# Privacy
This subsection helps to assess the impact of the AI system's impact on privacy and data protection, which are closely related to each other and to the right to integrity of a person, which covers the respect for a person’s mental and physical well being. 

To get better understanding of how machine learning was used in this project, check the machine learning report.

## Did you consider the impact of the AI system on the right to privacy, the right to physical, mental and/or moral integrity and the right to data protection?

Yes, the impact of our AI system on the right to privacy, the right to physical, mental, and/or moral integrity and the right to data protection has been considered. The proccess of choosing data for this project has maintained the right to privacy, physical and/or moral integrity and the right to data protection. Most of the data gethered is publicly available and not related to specific people (such as green score or crimes commited in a given neighborhood).

## Depending on the use case, did you establish mechanisms that allow flagging issues related to privacy concerning the AI system

No, since the modeling part was not the main part of the project (as the model was not reliable enough) and the use of the model is not advised, no such mechanism was implemented.

# Data Governance
This subsection helps to assess the adherence of the AI system's use to various
elements concerning data protection.

To get better understanding of what data was used in this project, check the technical data report.

## Is your AI system being trained, or was it developed, by using or processing personal data (including special categories of personal data)?

No, personal data was not used in the project. All the data was has been aggregated to the neighborhood level and any used data cannot be used to identify a singular person.

## Did you put in place any of the following measures some of which are mandatory under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), or a non-European equivalent?

No, as this project is using mostly publicly available data, and we do not use sensitive data, the GDPR measures mentioned are not applicable to us. Therfore, a DPIA, designate a DPO, and other mechanisms establishing oversight for data are not needed.

## Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)23;
- Designate a Data Protection Officer (DPO)24 and include them at an
early state in the development, procurement or use phase of the AI
system
- Oversight mechanisms for data processing (including limiting access
to qualified personnel, mechanisms for logging data access and
making modifications)
- Measures to achieve privacy-by-design and default (e.g. encryption,
pseudonymisation, aggregation, anonymisation)
- Data minimisation, in particular personal data (including special categories of data)

The project did not involve a Data Protection Officer or any oversight mechanism, since the data used in the project was mostly publicly available and not usable in the proccess of identifying a singular person.

## Did you implement the right to withdraw consent, the right to object and the right to be forgotten into the development of the AI system?

No, we did not collect any personal data. Therefore, these rights are not relevant to the project.

## Did you consider the privacy and data protection implications of data collected, generated or processed over the course of the AI system's life cycle?

Yes, all the datasets used have been thoroughly documented.

## Did you consider the privacy and data protection implications of the AI system's non-personal training-data or other processed non-personal data?

Major part of the data used in the project is publicaly available, so the data protection was not needed for most of it. As it comes to the data provided by Municipality of Breda that is not publicaly available, no special data protection means were considered.

## Did you align the AI system with relevant standards (e.g. ISO25, IEEE26) or widely adopted protocols for (daily) data management and governance?

No, the project was not aligned with any aforementioned standards.
