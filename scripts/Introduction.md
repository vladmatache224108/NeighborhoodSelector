# Introduction

### Welcome to our app! 
We are pleased to introduce our comprehensive data analysis project aimed at creating a better living environment in Breda. Our team, consisting of Wojciech Stachowiak, Bogdan Matache, Thijn van Oort and Panna Pfandler, has worked diligently to address four key goals.

### First of all, 
We created an expert system, embedded within this app which utilizes nine features to evaluate neighborhoods. By considering different requirements and assigning personalized weights to features, our purpose is to help individuals find the ideal neighborhood that aligns with their needs and preferences.

### Furthermore, 
Our expert system provides users with the flexibility to customize settings and generate reports highlighting the neighborhoods with the lowest scores. This feature enables stakeholders to identify areas that require improvement and focus on implementing necessary changes.

### Additionally, 
We conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) reports to provide valuable insights, with one report specifically focusing on crime rates. Ensuring the safety of our city is of utmost importance, and while Breda is generally considered safe, we recognize the ongoing need for reducing crime across different types. Through data analysis, we aimed to uncover patterns and underlying causes of crimes, enabling the development of targeted strategies for effective intervention. 

### Lastly, 
Our objective was to gain a comprehensive understanding of the factors that impact house prices and provide valuable insights to guide decision-making in the real estate market. However, despite our efforts, the performance of the machine learning model we developed fell short of expectations. We acknowledge the need for further refinement and improvement in order to deliver accurate and reliable predictions in this domain.

### On our website, 
You can access the ALTAI (AI Legal and Ethical Considerations) and DEDA (Data Ethics and Data Governance) reports. These reports were meticulously prepared to ensure transparency and compliance with legal and ethical guidelines. They exemplify our unwavering commitment to upholding ethical standards throughout our project, reflecting our dedication to responsible and conscientious practices.


### By working together, we believe that we can create a better Breda!
